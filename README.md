Started to learn something New

Hi firends!

John here, I am a perosn who strongly beleives that in the near future The 'CODE' is going to rule over the world in a physical sense.
But the other side of the coin is i know nothing about the code for the reason i had all my education in lifesceinces.
And as i came to know how things work in the e-world(computer wolrd), I came to know that the 'CODE'is the building block.

So, I am trying to learn something new through GitHub and freecodecamp. Hope friends in Git will help me through.
